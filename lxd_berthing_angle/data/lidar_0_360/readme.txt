All point cloud data has been converted to the ideal coordinate system.

Lidar1 folder contains the point cloud data obtained by Lidar1.
Lidar2 folder contains the point cloud data obtained by Lidar2.

Point cloud file name note:
"0lidar1.pcd" : point cloud data obtained by lidar1 when heading is 0
"0lidar2.pcd" : point cloud data obtained by lidar2 when heading is 0

Because all point cloud data files are large, more point cloud data need to download the compressed package, decompression after use
